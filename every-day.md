Preferrably, first thing in the morning. Most To-Do list apps will allow you to do these [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) in one way or another.

- [ ] Review Calendar, create required tasks on your Inbox
- [ ] Review Voice Memos, create required tasks on your Inbox
- [ ] Review Emails (and archive as many as possible), create required tasks on your Inbox
- [ ] Review Notepad (app or physical), create required tasks on your Inbox
- [ ] Review Weekly and Monthly Goals [^1], create required tasks on your Inbox
- [ ] Review Pending To-Do's (Today, Inbox, Anytime), move most critical to Today's list, lesser critical out of Today's list
- [ ] Prioritise and estimate Today's list
- [ ] Mark Important tasks in Today's list
- [ ] Mark Due Today tasks in Today's list

[1]: Create those lists if you don't have them already and make sure to review and update them accordingly. You should probably also have a Next Week and a Next Month list as well.
